# Predictive maintenance system for photovoltaic system

[**Update**: You can find the paper [here](https://onedrive.live.com/embed?resid=8d775148de787d87%211424&authkey=!AJFlhwnj7LJytiU&em=2)]

This study presents a predictive maintenance system for photovoltaic (PV) installations. It attempts to improve PV system efficiency and maintenance operations by utilizing AI algorithm such as fuzzy logic and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model.

Using fuzzy logic, this project analyzes 4 input data: solar irradiance, panel temperature, voltage output, and humidity. The fuzzy logic algorithm generates alertness levels (green, yellow, and red) to show the system's state of alertness, as well as performance categorization of the PV system (good, balanced, or poor). Additionally, by analyzing images of the panels, the CNN system accurately distinguishes between working and broken solar panels.

For those files I have uploaded:
1. RE_poster: This is the poster that I used to present the project
2. gui.py: Graphic User Interface by Python - The demo interface of the system using Tkinter library in Python
3. Fuzzy Logic folder:
     - Python Code: this is all code in Python
     - File ipynb: Jupyter file - Code with visualization
     - Fuzzy rules: 81 fuzzy rules with Excel
4. CNN folder:
     - Python code: this is all code in Python
     - File ipynb: Jupyter file - Code with visualization
     - Broken: images of broken solar panels - for CNN model training 
     - Working: images of working solar panels - for CNN model training

Benefits of the suggested predictive maintenance system include proactive maintenance planning, increased system dependability, and lower maintenance costs. The solution offers useful insights and enables prompt corrective measures with fuzzy logic and CNN models.
